over
the
grave
and
when
the
spring
sun
had
removed
it
again
the
man

himself
another
wife

wife
brought
two
daughters
into
the
house
with
her
they
were
beautiful
with
fair
faces
but
evil
and
dark
hearts
times
soon
grew
very
bad
for
the
poor
stepchild
why
should
that
stupid
goose
sit
in
the
parlor
with
us
they
said
if
she
wants
to
eat
bread
then
she
will
have
to
earn
it
out
with
this
kitchen
maid
they
took
her
beautiful
clothes
away
from
her
dressed
her
in
an
old
gray
smock
and
gave
her
wooden
shoes
just
look
at
the
proud
princess
how
decked
out
she
is
they
shouted
and
laughed
as
they
led
her
into
the
kitchen
there
she
had
to
do
hard
work
from
morning
until
evening
get
up
before
daybreak
carry
water
make
the
fires
cook
and
wash
besides
this
the
sisters
did
everything
imaginable
to
hurt
her
they
made
fun
of
her
scattered
peas
and
lentils
into
the
ashes
for
her
so
that
she
had
to
sit
and
pick
them
out
again
in
the
evening
when
she
had
worked
herself
weary
there
was
no
bed
for
her
instead
she
had
to
sleep
by
the
hearth
in
the
ashes
and
because
she
always
looked
dusty
and
dirty
they
called
her
cinderella
one
day
it
happened
that
the
father
was
going
to
the
fair
and
he
asked
his
two
stepdaughters
what
he
should
bring
back
for
them
beautiful
dresses
said
the
one
pearls
and
jewels
said
the
other
and
you
cinderella
he
said
what
do
you
want
father
break
off
for
me
the
first
twig
that
brushes
against
your
hat
on
your
way
home
so
he
bought
beautiful
dresses
pearls
and
jewels
for
his
two
stepdaughters
on
his
way
home
as
he
was
riding
through
a
green
thicket
a
hazel
twig
brushed
against
him
and
knocked
off
his
hat
then
he
broke
off
the
twig
and
took
it
with
him
arriving
home
he
gave
his
stepdaughters
the
things
that
they
had
asked
for
and
he
gave
cinderella
the
twig
from
the
hazel
bush
cinderella
thanked
him
went
to
her
mother's
grave
and
planted
the
branch
on
it
and
she
wept
so
much
that
her
tears
fell
upon
it
and
watered
it
it
grew
and
became
a
beautiful
tree
cinderella
went
to
this
tree
three
times
every
day
and
beneath
it
she
wept
and
prayed
a
white
bird
came
to
the
tree
every
time
and
whenever
she
expressed
a
wish
the
bird
would
throw
down
to
her
what
she
had
wished
for
now
it
happened
that
the
king
proclaimed
a
festival
that
was
to
last
three
days
all
the
beautiful
young
girls
in
the
land
were
invited
so
that
his
son
could
select
a
bride
for
himself
when
the
two
stepsisters
heard
that
they
too
had
been
invited
they
were
in
high
spirits
they
called
cinderella
saying
comb
our
hair
for
us

our
shoes
and
fasten
our
buckles
we
are
going
to
the
festival
at
the
king's
castle
cinderella
obeyed
but
wept
because
she
too
would
have
liked
to
go
to
the
dance
with
them
she
begged
her
stepmother
to
allow
her
to
go

she
said

all
covered
with
dust
and
dirt
and
you
want
to
go
to
the
festival
you
have
neither
clothes
nor
shoes
and
yet
you
want
to
dance
however
because
cinderella
kept
asking
the
stepmother
finally
said
i
have
scattered
a
bowl
of
lentils
into
the
ashes
for
you
if
you
can
pick
them
out
again
in
two
hours
then
you
may
go

door
into
the
garden
and
called
out

white
pigeons
came
in
through

window
and
then
the

all

came
whirring
and
swarming
in
and
lit
around
the
ashes
the
pigeons
nodded
their
heads
and
began
to

before
they
were

and
they
all
flew
out
again
the
girl
took
the
bowl
to
her
stepmother
and
was
happy

the

said

would
only
laugh
at

to
cry
and
then
the
stepmother
said

may
go
if
you
are
able
to
pick
two
bowls
of
lentils
out
of
the
ashes
for
me
in
one
hour
thinking
to
herself
she
will
never
be
able
to
do
that
the
girl
went
through
the
back
door
into
the
garden
and
called
out
you
tame

and
all
you

and
was
happy

she
would

but
the
stepmother
said
it's

us
for
you
have
no
clothes
and
you
don't
know
how
to

we
would
be
ashamed
of
you
with
this
she
turned
her
back
on
cinderella
and
hurried
away
with
her
two
proud
daughters
now
that
no
one
else
was
at
home
cinderella
went
to
her
mother's
grave
beneath
the
hazel
tree
and
cried
out
shake
and
quiver
little
tree
throw
gold
and
silver
down
to
me
then
the
bird
threw
a
gold
and
silver
dress
down
to
her
and
slippers
embroidered
with
silk
and
silver
she
quickly
put
on
the
dress
and
went
to
the
festival
her
stepsisters
and
her
stepmother
did
not
recognize
her
they
thought
she
must
be
a
foreign
princess
for
she
looked
so
beautiful
in
the
golden
dress
they
never
once
thought
it
was
cinderella
for
they
thought
that
she
was
sitting
at
home
in
the
dirt
looking
for
lentils
in
the
ashes
the
prince
approached
her
took
her
by
the
hand
and
danced
with
her
furthermore
he
would
dance
with
no
one
else
he
never
let
go
of
her
hand
and
whenever
anyone
else
came
and
asked
her
to
dance
he
would
say
she
is
my
dance
partner
she
danced
until
evening
and
then
she
wanted
to
go
home
but
the
prince
said
i
will
go
along
and
escort
you
for
he
wanted
to
see
to
whom
the
beautiful
girl
belonged
however
she
eluded
him
and
jumped
into
the
pigeon
coop
the
prince
waited
until
her
father
came
and
then
he
told
him
that
the
unknown
girl
had
jumped
into
the
pigeon
coop
the
old
man
thought
could
it
be
cinderella
he
had
them
bring
him
an
ax
and
a
pick
so
that
he
could
break
the
pigeon
coop
apart
but
no
one
was
inside
when
they
got
home
cinderella
was
lying
in
the
ashes
dressed
in
her
dirty
clothes
a
dim
little
oil
lamp
was
burning
in
the
fireplace
cinderella
had
quickly
jumped
down
from
the
back
of
the
pigeon
coop
and
had
run
to
the
hazel
tree
there
she
had
taken
off
her
beautiful
clothes
and
laid
them
on
the
grave
and
the
bird
had
taken
them
away
again
then
dressed
in
her
gray
smock
she
had
returned
to
the
ashes
in
the
kitchen
the
next
day
when
the
festival
began
anew
and
her
parents
and
her
stepsisters
had
gone
again
cinderella
went
to
the
hazel
tree
and
said
shake
and
quiver
little
tree
throw
gold
and
silver
down
to
me
then
the
bird
threw
down
an
even
more
magnificent
dress
than
on
the
preceding
day
when
cinderella
appeared
at
the
festival
in
this
dress
everyone
was
astonished
at
her
beauty
the
prince
had
waited
until
she
came
then
immediately
took
her
by
the
hand
and
danced
only
with
her
when
others
came
and
asked
her
to
dance
with
them
he
said
she
is
my
dance
partner
when
evening
came
she
wanted
to
leave
and
the
prince
followed
her
wanting
to
see
into
which
house
she
went
but
she
ran
away
from
him
and
into
the
garden
behind
the
house
a
beautiful
tall
tree
stood
there
on
which
hung
the
most
magnificent
pears
she
climbed
as
nimbly
as
a
squirrel
into
the
branches
and
the
prince
did
not
know
where
she
had
gone
he
waited
until
her
father
came
then
said
to
him
the
unknown
girl
has
eluded
me
and
i
believe
she
has
climbed
up
the
pear
tree
the
father
thought
could
it
be
cinderella
he
had
an
ax
brought
to
him
and
cut
down
the
tree
but
no
one
was
in
it
when
they
came
to
the
kitchen
cinderella
was
lying
there
in
the
ashes
as
usual
for
she
had
jumped
down
from
the
other
side
of
the
tree
had
taken
the
beautiful
dress
back
to
the
bird
in
the
hazel
tree
and
had
put
on
her
gray
smock
on
the
third
day
when
her
parents
and
sisters
had
gone
away
cinderella
went
again
to
her
mother's
grave
and
said
to
the
tree
shake
and
quiver
little
tree
throw
gold
and
silver
down
to
me
this
time
the
bird
threw
down
to
her
a
dress
that
was
more
splendid
and
magnificent
than
any
she
had
yet
had
and
the
slippers
were
of
pure
gold
when
she
arrived
at
the
festival
in
this
dress
everyone
was
so
astonished
that
they
did
not
know
what
to
say
the
prince
danced
only
with
her
and
whenever
anyone
else
asked
her
to
dance
he
would
say
she
is
my
dance
partner
when
evening
came
cinderella
wanted
to
leave
and
the
prince
tried
to
escort
her
but
she
ran
away
from
him
so
quickly
that
he
could
not
follow
her
the
prince
however
had
set
a
trap
he
had
had
the
entire
stairway
smeared
with
pitch
when
she
ran
down
the
stairs
her
left
slipper
stuck
in
the
pitch
the
prince
picked
it
up
it
was
small
and
dainty
and
of
pure
gold
the
next
morning
he
went
with
it
to
the
man
and
said
to
him
no
one
shall
be
my
wife
except
for
the
one
whose
foot
fits
this
golden
shoe
the
two
sisters
were
happy
to
hear
this
for
they
had
pretty
feet
with
her
mother
standing
by
the
older
one
took
the
shoe
into
her
bedroom
to
try
it
on
she
could
not
get
her
big
toe
into
it
for
the
shoe
was
too
small
for
her
then
her
mother
gave
her
a
knife
and
said
cut
off
your
toe
when
you
are
queen
you
will
no
longer
have
to
go
on
foot
the
girl
cut
off
her
toe
forced
her
foot
into
the
shoe
swallowed
the
pain
and
went
out
to
the
prince
he
took
her
on
his
horse
as
his
bride
and
rode
away
with
her
however
they
had
to
ride
past
the
grave
and
there
on
the
hazel
tree
sat
the
two
pigeons
crying
out
rook
di
goo
rook
di
goo
there's
blood
in
the
shoe
the
shoe
is
too
tight
this
bride
is
not
right
then
he
looked
at
her
foot
and
saw
how
the
blood
was
running
from
it
he
turned
his
horse
around
and
took
the
false
bride
home
again
saying
that
she
was
not
the
right
one
and
that
the
other
sister
should
try
on
the
shoe
she
went
into
her
bedroom
and
got
her
toes
into
the
shoe
all
right
but
her
heel
was
too
large
then
her
mother
gave
her
a
knife
and
said
cut
a
piece
off
your
heel
when
you
are
queen
you
will
no
longer
have
to
go
on
foot
the
girl
cut
a
piece
off
her
heel
forced
her
foot
into
the
shoe
swallowed
the
pain
and
went
out
to
the
prince
he
took
her
on
his
horse
as
his
bride
and
rode
away
with
her
when
they
passed
the
hazel
tree
the
two
pigeons
were
sitting
in
it
and
they
cried
out
rook
di
goo
rook
di
goo
there's
blood
in
the
shoe
the
shoe
is
too
tight
this
bride
is
not
right
he
looked
down
at
her
foot
and
saw
how
the
blood
was
running
out
of
her
shoe
and
how
it
had
stained
her
white
stocking
all
red
then
he
turned
his
horse
around
and
took
the
false
bride
home
again
this
is
not
the
right
one
either
he
said
don't
you
have
another
daughter
no
said
the
man
there
is
only
a
deformed
little
cinderella
from
my
first
wife
but
she
cannot
possibly
be
the
bride
the
prince
told
him
to
send
her
to
him
but
the
mother
answered
oh
no
she
is
much
too
dirty
she
cannot
be
seen
but
the
prince
insisted
on
it
and
they
had
to
call
cinderella
she
first
washed
her
hands
and
face
clean
and
then
went
and
bowed
down
before
the
prince
who
gave
her
the
golden
shoe
she
sat
down
on
a
stool
pulled
her
foot
out
of
the
heavy
wooden
shoe
and
put
it
into
the
slipper
and
it
fitted
her
perfectly
when
she
stood
up
the
prince
looked
into
her
face
and
he
recognized
the
beautiful
girl
who
had
danced
with
him
he
cried
out
she
is
my
true
bride
the
stepmother
and
the
two
sisters
were
horrified
and
turned
pale
with
anger
the
prince
however
took
cinderella
onto
his
horse
and
rode
away
with
her
as
they
passed
by
the
hazel
tree
the
two
white
pigeons
cried
out
rook
di
goo
rook
di
goo
no
blood's
in
the
shoe
the
shoe's
not
too
tight
this
bride
is
right
after
they
had
cried
this
out
they
both
flew
down
and
lit
on
cinderella's
shoulders
one
on
the
right
the
other
on
the
left
and
remained
sitting
there
when
the
wedding
with
the
prince
was
to
be
held
the
two
false
sisters
came
wanting
to
gain
favor
with
cinderella
and
to
share
her
good
fortune
when
the
bridal
couple
walked
into
the
church
the
older
sister
walked
on
their
right
side
and
the
younger
on
their
left
side
and
the
pigeons
pecked
out
one
eye
from
each
of
them
afterwards
as
they
came
out
of
the
church
the
older
one
was
on
the
left
side
and
the
younger
one
on
the
right
side
and
then
the
pigeons
pecked
out
the
other
eye
from
each
of
them
and
thus
for
their
wickedness
and
falsehood
they
were
punished
with
blindness
as
long
as
they
lived
